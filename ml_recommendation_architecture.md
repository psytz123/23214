    # Check feedback signals
    feedback_metrics = analyze_recent_feedback(model_id)
    if feedback_indicates_retraining(feedback_metrics):
        return True, "feedback_signals"
    
    return False, None

def retrain_model(model_id, reason):
    # Get model metadata
    model_metadata = get_model_metadata(model_id)

    elif reason == "performance_degradation":
        # Focus on problematic cases
        training_params = get_performance_recovery_params(model_type)
    elif reason == "feedback_signals":
        # Incorporate feedback data
        training_params = get_feedback_integration_params(model_type)
    else:
        # Standard retraining
        training_params = get_standard_training_params(model_type)
    
    # Prepare training data
    train_data, val_data, test_data = prepare_training_data(model_type, training_params)
    
    # Train new model version
    new_model_id = train_model(train_data, val_data, test_data, model_type)
    
    # Evaluate new model
    evaluation_results = evaluate_model_upgrade(model_id, new_model_id, test_data)
    
    # Deploy if improved
    if evaluation_results["should_deploy"]:
        deploy_model(new_model_id, replace_model_id=model_id)

    # Get recent feature data
    recent_data = get_recent_feature_data(model_id, days=window_size)
    
    # Calculate distribution metrics
    distribution_metrics = {}
    for feature in reference_distribution:
        reference = reference_distribution[feature]
        current = calculate_feature_distribution(recent_data, feature)
        
        # Calculate statistical distance
        if is_numerical_feature(feature):
            distance = calculate_ks_distance(reference, current)
        else:
            distance = calculate_js_divergence(reference, current)
        
        distribution_metrics[feature] = {
            "distance": distance,
            "reference": reference,
            "current": current
        }

    return significant_drift, performance_drift, performance_changes
```

### 8.4 Model Versioning and Rollback

Mechanisms for managing model versions and reverting to previous versions when necessary.

**Versioning Strategy**:

1. **Version Control**:
   - Unique identifiers for each model version
   - Comprehensive metadata for each version
   - Training data lineage tracking
   - Performance benchmark preservation

2. **Deployment Management**:
   - Controlled rollout of new versions
   - Canary testing before full deployment
   - A/B testing for major changes
   - Shadow mode evaluation for critical models

3. **Rollback Mechanisms**:
   - Automated performance monitoring with alerts
   - Quick rollback procedures for emergencies
   - Partial rollbacks for specific user segments
   - Gradual rollback for non-critical issues

4. **Version Lifecycle Management**:
   - Archiving of older versions
   - Retention policies for model artifacts
   - Documentation of version history
   - Audit trail of deployment decisions

**Implementation**:

```python
# Pseudocode for model versioning and rollback
def create_model_version(model_type, model_artifact, training_metadata):
    # Generate version identifier
    version_id = generate_version_id(model_type)
