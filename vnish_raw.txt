VNISH TOOLKIT AND API INFORMATION

From toolkit.vnish.com:
- Comprehensive statistics: Monitor key performance indicators of your equipment
- Mass management: Clone settings, reduce management time. Whatever is available for one miner is available for all
- Easy filtering and sorting: Find exactly the devices you need with filters and sorting options
- User-friendly functionality: Customise your workspace to suit your needs, identifying the most important metrics to achieve operational efficiency
- Automation: Perform customization and automatic firmware updates in the system. The system will notify you when there are updates available
- Mass installation: Ability to install firmware on an unlimited number of miners in one network at the same time

From vnish.group FAQ:
- API Documentation: You can view the documentation in the firmware itself by opening http://miner_IPaddress/docs/ in the address bar
- Vnish firmware supports multiple Antminer models (S19, T19, L7, S21, S21XP, and others)
- Built-in API endpoints accessible via the miner's web interface
- APIs provide detailed telemetry data including hashrate, temperature, power consumption, and chip status
- Data formatted in JSON for easy integration
- Temperature management with auto temperature presets
- Sensor bypass capabilities for faulty temperature sensors
- Mass deployment and configuration using Hashcore Toolkit

API Features:
- Summary Data: Total hashrate, temperature, power consumption, and status
- Chips Data: Individual chip hashrates, temperature readings, and throttling status
- Chains and Boards: Data on hashboard health, chain status, and operational parameters
